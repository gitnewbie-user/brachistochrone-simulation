# Brachistochrone Problem Simulation

A Python animation showing that the fastest path between two points under gravity is a cycloid curve, not a straight line!

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
python brach.py
```

## What You'll See
- Blue ball follows the optimal cycloid path
- Red ball follows the straight line  
- Real-time timers show the cycloid wins!

## The Physics
The brachistochrone demonstrates that nature takes the fastest path, not the shortest one. The cycloid curve allows the ball to gain speed quickly by dropping steeply at first.

This classic problem helped establish calculus of variations in mathematics.
